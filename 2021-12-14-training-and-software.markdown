In this post, I'll link to a few training materials and software packages that might be useful to new starters in our lab (or elsewhere). I intend for this to be updated regularly, so please feel free to suggest changes or additions. A big thank you to everyone that has put these online resources together, we find them invaluable!


## Workshops

[CCP-BioSim.][ccpbiosim] Excellent set of training modules and Youtube channel. Subjects include biomolecular dynamics, FESetup, BioSimSpace and Python for biomolecular modelling.

[Bespoke-fit.][bespokefit] A workshop describing the use of Open Force Field's [bespoke-fit package][bespokefit-github] for fitting molecule-specific torsion parameters, given by own Josh Horton.

[TeachOpenCADD.][teachopencadd] Really useful set of talktorials on the use of open source cheminformatics tools for computer-aided drug design.

[Data science.][turing]


## Research Software

[QUBEKit.][qubekit]

[Open Force Field.][openff] We're very happy to be working with the OpenForceField initiative, and we make extensive use of their software infrastructure in our work. A good place to start is with the [documentation examples][openff1] on building and interacting with molecules, and a [set of notebooks][openff2], which show how to use the toolkit to parameterise a system and run a short simulation in OpenMM.

[OpenMM.][openmm]

[BioSimSpace / SOMD.][bss] Python framework for biomolecular simulation, includes a [set of tutorials][bss-tut] for common simulation types. [Our own tutorials][somd-qube] written with Julien Michel's lab show how to use SOMD in protein-ligand binding and hydration free energy calculations with different force fields.


[RDKit.][rdkit] 

[DeLinker.][delinker]

[Gnina.][gnina]

[ONETEP.][onetep]



## Miscellaneous

[Pymol.]

[Machine learning.]
