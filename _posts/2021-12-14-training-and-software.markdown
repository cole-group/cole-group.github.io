In this post, I'll link to a few training materials and software packages that might be useful to new starters in our group (or elsewhere). I intend for this to be updated regularly, so please feel free to suggest changes or additions, particularly if links break. A big thank you to everyone that has made these resources available online, we find them invaluable!


## Workshops

[CCP-BioSim.][ccpbiosim] Excellent set of training modules and Youtube channel. Subjects include biomolecular dynamics, FESetup, BioSimSpace and Python for biomolecular modelling.

[RSC Chemical Information and Computer Applications Group.][rsc-cicag] Highly recommended series of webinars on open source tools for chemistry, including cheminformatics, docking (gnina), chimeraX and pymol.

[Bespoke-fit.][bespokefit] A workshop describing the use of Open Force Field's [bespoke-fit package][bespokefit-github] for fitting molecule-specific torsion parameters, given by our own Josh Horton.

[TeachOpenCADD.][teachopencadd] Really useful set of talktorials on the use of open source cheminformatics tools for computer-aided drug design.

[Data science.][turing] The Alan Turing Instituteâ€™s Introduction to Research Data Science course, including the associated [github repo][turing-github].

[Molecular Software Sciences Institute.][molssi] Highly recommended workshops on topics including programming and molecular modelling. 



## Research Software

[QUBEKit.][qubekit] Our own Quantum Mechanical Bespoke Force Field Derivation Toolkit, by Chris Ringrose and Josh Horton. More tutorials coming soon, watch this space!

[Open Force Field.][openff] We're very happy to be working with the Open Force Field initiative, and we make extensive use of their software infrastructure in our work. A good place to start is with the [documentation examples][openff1] on building and interacting with molecules, and a [set of notebooks][openff2], which show how to use the toolkit to parameterise a system and run a short simulation in OpenMM.

[OpenMM.][openmm] All of our atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are performed through OpenMM. A few tutorials are available [here][openmm-tut], with more to follow I believe.

[BioSimSpace / SOMD.][bss] Python framework for biomolecular simulation, includes a [set of tutorials][bss-tut] for common simulation types. [Our own tutorials][somd-qube] written with Julien Michel's lab show how to use SOMD in protein-ligand binding and hydration free energy calculations with different force fields.

[RDKit.][rdkit] Open source cheminformatics toolkit, which we use in virtually all our workflows. You'll find many tutorials online, including [Getting started with RDKit in python][rdkit-tut] and introductory youtube tutorials by Jan Jensen: [Tutorial 1][rdkit1]; [Tutorial 2][rdkit2].

[QCEngine.][qcengine]

[ONETEP.][onetep] Several of our projects involve large-scale DFT calculations, often working with the ONETEP community. Frequent workshops are run and [tutorials][onetep-tut] are available online.

[DeLinker.][delinker]

[Gnina.][gnina]




## Miscellaneous

[Learning Scientific Programming with Python.][python] The course textbook for my undergraduate Python classes (Newcastle students, feel free to message me for access to course materials). Textbook should be available through Newcastle University library.

[Machine learning.]

[In Silico Medicinal Chemistry: Computational Methods to Support Drug Design][brown] Book by Nathan Brown on computational tools for drug design. Should be available through Newcastle University library.

[Pymol.]

[QCArchive.]
