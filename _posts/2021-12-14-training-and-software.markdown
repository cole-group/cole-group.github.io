In this post, I'll link to a few other blog posts, training materials, and software packages that might be useful to new starters in our lab (or elsewhere). I intend for this to be updated regularly, so please feel free to suggest changes or additions. A big thank you to everyone that has put these online resources together, we find them invaluable!


## Workshops

[CCP-BioSim.][ccpbiosim] Excellent set of training modules and Youtube channel. Subjects include biomolecular dynamics, FESetup, BioSimSpace and Python for biomolecular modelling.



## Software

[Open Force Field.][openff] We're very happy to be working with the OpenForceField initiative, and we make extensive use of their software infrastructure in our work. A good place to start is with the [documentation examples][openff1] on building and interacting with molecules, and a [set of notebooks][openff2], which show how to use the toolkit to parameterise a system and run a short simulation in OpenMM.
