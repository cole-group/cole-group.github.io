Recently a team of us from Newcastle University were fortunate enough
to enter the second Critical Assessment of Computational Hit-Finding
Experiments (CACHE) Challenge. The full team comprised: Ben Cree,
Rachael Pirie, Mat Bieniek, Josh Horton and [Daniel Cole](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/people/profile/danielcole.html) (computational
chemistry), [Roly Armstrong](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/people/profile/rolyarmstrong.html) and [Kate Harris](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/cancer/people/profile/kateharris.html) (medicinal chemistry) and
[Natalie Tatum](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/natalietatum.html) (structural biology).


# What is CACHE?

The CACHE challenges are a set of prospective benchmarking exercises
on computational hit-finding predictions, led by researchers at the
[Structural Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org). Every few months an open hit finding
exercise is advertised with the goal of identifying new chemical
starting points against biologically relevant targets. By purchasing
and testing the compounds, the organisers are able to benchmark the
effectiveness of new computational methods. Each challenge has two hit
finding cycles to enable elaboration of first round hits.

More details may be found
[online](https://cache-challenge.org/what-cache) and in this [review
paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-022-00363-z).

We are hugely grateful to the CACHE organisers for allowing us to
enter, and for the experimental data shown here (any errors are our
own!).



# What is the target in challenge 2?

*Target and fragments, include water map*



# Design Strategy

Explain FEgrow and general 5-membered ring showing three vectors. End with best design.

*Example compound designs with scores*





# Synthesis and Enamine similarity

Show synthesised compounds and examples of similarity searches that correlate with design strategies (also show top scoring and hit).

# Round 1 hit and free energy calculations

Get hit, elaborate hit, test designs with FEP, suggest round 2.
